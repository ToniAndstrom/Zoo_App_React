This Zoo-app was made as a task for my schools (Helsinki Business College) React class using the basics of React.
The task was started during class taught by Margit Tennosaar and our task was to finish it and make "ours".

Technologies used: React.

Unfortunately the livepage doesn't show my images that don't originate from unsplash and I was unable to find a solution for this before the given deadline.
